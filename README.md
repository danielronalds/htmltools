# HTML Tools

A collection of standalone HTML utilities. Each tool is a self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript - no build system or dependencies required.

All tools are almost exclusively created through the use of AI.

## Usage

The tools are hosted on GitHub pages, [here](https://danielronalds.github.io/htmltools/)

Optionally, they can be run locally. Each HTML file is completely self contained, and can be hosted statically.

## Features

- Dark/light mode toggle (persists across sessions)
- Keyboard navigation (Escape returns to home)
- State persistence via localStorage
- No external dependencies (except Font Awesome icons via CDN)
